# PhantomTTY

PhantomTTY is a terminal emulator built with Rust using the egui framework. It provides a lightweight, unusable terminal experience with features like command history, tab completion, and a disgusting and unusable graphical interface.

## Features

- terminal emulation
- Command history with up/down arrow navigation
- Tab completion for commands and file paths
- Terrible and borderline unusable graphical interface
- Lightweight and it preforms

## Installation

To install PhantomTTY, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, you can get them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

Once you have Rust and Cargo, you can clone this repository and build the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/0xGingi/PhantomTTY.git
cd PhantomTTY
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be located in the `target/release` directory.
